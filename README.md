# Marozi

This app is named after a [special kind of Lion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marozi) which is still not known to exist.

## Installation

This is a very basic installation instruction in order to get the app running (currently only tested on Mac OS)

### Homebrew

All installation steps are based on [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

### Git

The version control is essential for getting the latest code

~~~ sh
$ brew install git
~~~~

### Ruby

As the system bundled ruby is too old. A ruby-version switcher must be used.

If you know what you are doing, use either [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/).

For everyone else, follow the instructions to install rbenv:


~~~ sh
$ brew install rbenv                                                    # install rbenv
$ brew install ruby-build                                               # install ruby version installer
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile        # modify PATH to load rbenv before system ruby
$ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile                      # add sugar to rbenv usage
$ source ~/.bash_profile                                                # reload configuration
$ rbenv install 2.0.0-p0                                                # install latest ruby version
~~~

### MongoDB

The datastore needs to be installed on the machine

~~~ sh
$ brew install mongo
~~~

Read the instruction on the terminal output. It should instruct you to do something like:

~~~ sh
$ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mongodb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist
~~~

### Bundler

[Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) handles the installation of 3rd party libraries (needs to be installed after Ruby):

~~~ sh
$ gem install bundler
$ rebenv rehash
~~~

## Setup environment

First clone the source code from github:

~~~ sh
$ cd <projects_dir>
$ git clone git://github.com/leo-clubs/marozi.git
~~~

Afterwards change into the directory and install all needed libraries (gems)

~~~ sh
$ cd <projects_dir>/marozi
$ bundle install --path vendor/local
$ rbenv rehash
~~~

Now setup the default config

~~~ sh
$ cd <projects_dir>/marozi
$ bin/setup.sh
~~~

## Import XML

For a fully functional system, you'll need a Full Leo Export xml. Afterwards import it into your database (all previously edited data will be gone):

~~~ sh
$ cd <projects_dir>/marozi
$ mkdir tmp
$ cp <XML_FILE> tmp/
$ bundle exec rake db:purge && bundle exec rake 'db:import_from_xml[tmp/LeoExport-FULL.xml]'
~~~

## Start application

Now just start the application (Port 3000 must be available)

~~~ sh
$ bundle exec rails s
~~~

Now the application is available under [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Upgrade

After code changes it is necessary to update the local code bases in order to see the changes take effect. Therefore several steps are necessary.

### Update Code

Pull the latest changes to your local code base

~~~ sh
$ cd <projects_dir>/marozi
$ git pull origin master
~~~

### Install new dependencies

Dependent Libraries may also change

~~~ sh
$ cd <projects_dir>/marozi
$ bundle install
~~~

### Restart server

Most of the time this step is not necessary. However after larger changes the server needs to be restarted. go to window where the server is running and kill it (via Ctrl + C). Afterwards start it again:

~~~ sh
$ cd <projects_dir>/marozi
$ bundle exec rails s
~~~
